              Over the past 22 years, a small renaissance group started
              envisioning together about creating a safe haven, a new society,
              with a common goal to give a path to all who come in good will
              looking for a better life, not a place to take-away opportunities
              from others. Bir Tawil, located between Egypt and Sudan, is a land
              that has not been claimed by any state. Under international law it
              is known as Terra Nullius, a “no man’s land.” It is a historically
              significant region which formerly has been part of the legendary
              Kingdom of Kush. It is now home to an inspiring resurrectional
              plan to create the next Dubai-like Kingdom of Kush – a social
              development, where opportunity aligns with the need for innovative
              infrastructure, sustainable housing, renewable energy, clean
              water, and localized food security.
